            <p>I'm currently a research assistant within the Nuclear Engineering department's HEAT Lab, led by Prof. Guanyu Su. We are studying the thermal-hydraulics 
                of modern nuclear reactors for the pursuit of clean energy solutions. My work focuses on the deployment of fiber optic temperature sensors for use in 
                sodium-cooled fast reactors. With the extreme internal temperatures of these systems, we aim to develop and fine-tune high resolution, low footprint
                fiber sensors to characterize and monitor fluid phenomena. To this end, we have conducted CFD simulations to understand fluid behavior in molten-salt
                loops and determine how additional information (especially velocity) can be gleaned from periodic temperature signals.</p>
